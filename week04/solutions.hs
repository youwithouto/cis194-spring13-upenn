{-
The first parameters, i.e., the function, taken by foldl and foldr do a similar job, which is putting a new element into the accumulated list, but the the difference is the sequence of the functions parameters.
foldl's first parameter takes the list as its first argument; while foldr's first parameter takes the list as its second argument.
